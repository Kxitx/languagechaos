            <br>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Many Questions on the Kelutral Discord server are not about the language itself, but about how to learn it. Finding a path to go can be hard, especially if that is the first foreign language you learn. This Document is designed to give people an idea of how they could keep going and do something with the language every day, for 100 days.<br>This guide is divided into ten chapters with ten days each. The first five chapters focus on making you study the basic grammar concepts and using them regularly, while the second half focuses on practical skills like writing, speaking, reading and listening and only occasionally makes you aware of some theoretical points you might still be missing.</p>
            <p>Some things to consider while following the 100 days:<br><b>This is not a textbook.</b> There are no explanations included, the document wants you to explore other resources and/or interact with the community to learn. All this Document is is a List of activities, if you do one a day you will not have the problem “what to do now?” for the next 100 days.<br><b>You don't have to follow these days in the exact order, or do one day per day.</b> The chapters build on each other, but if the pace is too fast or too slow, feel free to go through the days faster or spend two days on one day. It is impossible to create something that has the perfect speed for everyone, so use these days in the way they are the most useful for you! And if that means that you want to learn infixes before the whole noun stuff, then feel free to switch around the chapters!<br><b>Do I have to learn the word of the day or fulfill the chapter task and the extra challenges?</b> Of course not. Use the parts of the document you find helpful for yourself and leave those out which are too much for you to do.<br><b>I am not on Kelutral, but in another Na’vi community or in none at all. What should I do?</b> Many parts of this document directly ask you to use the advantages of a language community and interact there. Also I very often refer to features of the Kelutral community like the daily questions the Eytukan bot asks there, and the resource overview there, because that is the community I am active in. Of course you can follow these days also in another community like for example Learn Na’vi, but you’ll have to adapt some small things then. But since interaction is the most important part of learning a new language and also a big part of this document, you should at least be part of one language community in order to be as successful as possible in your language learning journey.</p>
            <p>With all of this said, let's finally start: <b>Nivume nìprrte’ nga - May you learn with pleasure!</b></p>
            
            
            <h2>Links</h2>
            <p><a href="/Na'vi/days/#one">- <b>Chapter one</b></a> - The first steps <br>In this chapter you will do the first stepts of your learning journey. This involves finding out which tools there are for you to use, but also learning some basic words and the first bits of grammar so you can start building your own sentences.<br><i><b>Grammar topics:</b> Pronunciation, simple sentences, subject and direct object, indirect object, lu vs. 'efu vs. tok</i></p>
            <p><a href="/Na'vi/days/#two">- <b>Chapter two</b></a> - Nouns! <br>You can write simple sentences, now it's time to get more details into them by describing nouns. In this chapter you'll learn a lot of ways to do that!<br><i><b>Grammar topics:</b> Plural, adjectives, describing subclauses, this and that and more, genitive</i></p>
            <p><a href="/Na'vi/days/#three">- <b>Chapter three</b></a> - Verbs! <br>The next very important word group we have to look at in detail are verbs. In Na'vi they work a bit different from English, and in this chapter you will learn about that!<br><i><b>Grammar topics:</b> Tense, positive/negative mood, adverbs, adpositions, aspect, subjunctive, combined infixes</i></p>  
            <p><a href="/Na'vi/days/#four">- <b>Chapter four</b></a> - Connecting Sentences <br>Writing short sentences is great, but what is even better is connecting multiple sentences to more complex ones. So that is what you will learn in this chapter!<br><i><b>Grammar topics:</b> Basic conjunctions, if-clauses, f-words, temporal clauses</i></p>  
            <p><a href="/Na'vi/days/#five">- <b>Chapter five</b></a> - Last Bits of Base Grammar <br>You already know a lot, now it is time to take a look at some last bits of the basic grammar topics. Of course after this chapter there will still be a lot to learn, but you'll know all the important basics!<br><i><b>Grammar topics:</b> Topical, negation, questions, comparisons, </i></p>
            <p><a href="/Na'vi/days/#six">- <b>Chapter six</b></a> - Let's Speak! <br>If you are the average Na'vi learner, then probably until now you have avoided to actually speak the language. Many people are afraid of starting to speak, but it is the only way to gain more fluency! So this chapter will try to help you with that.<br><i><b>Grammar topics:</b> Causative, reflexive</i></p>
            <p><a href="/Na'vi/days/#seven">- <b>Chapter seven</b></a> - Let's Listen! <br>This chapter you'll focus on improving your listening skills. Listening is a skill that can only be acquired by actually listening to spoken Na'vi, so let's do exactly that!<br><i><b>Grammar topics:</b> Participles, numbers</i></p>  
            <p><a href="/Na'vi/days/#eight">- <b>Chapter eight</b></a> - Let's Write <br>Probably most of your Na'vi communication will be written, so let's practice that a bit! Since you already practiced speaking a bit at this point, some writing should not be a problem for you.<br><i><b>Grammar topics:</b> Some more affixes, particles</i></p>  
            <p><a href="/Na'vi/days/#nine">- <b>Chapter nine</b></a> - And again Speaking <br>Speaking is the most effective thing to do when you want to learn a language, so let's focus on that again!<br><i><b>Grammar topics:</b> Direct and indirect speech, &lt;ats&gt; infix</i></p>  
            <p><a href="/Na'vi/days/#ten">- <b>Chapter ten</b></a> - The last Steps <br>You are nearly done with this 100 days challenge, in this chapter you will do some more practice and learn some last important things. Also it is time to think about what you want to do after you finished all 100 days!<br><i><b>Grammar topics:</b> Commands, polite speech</i></p>  

            <h2 id="one">Chapter one - The first Steps</h2>
            <p>In the first chapter you will start your learning journey, find useful tools to use in the future and learn your first few pieces of grammar!</p>
            <p><b>Chapter Challenge:</b>  Can you introduce yourself in Na’vi in the nìNa’vi nì’aw (Na’vi only) chat in the Kelutral Discord server before you finish this chapter? Greet everyone, tell them your name and try to add any additional information you wanna give - even if you haven’t learned how to say something you can already try, someone surely will correct you and help you learn even faster!</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/Na'vi/days/#001">001</a> | <a href="/Na'vi/days/#002">002</a> | <a href="/Na'vi/days/#003">003 | <a href="/Na'vi/days/#004">004</a> | <a href="/Na'vi/days/#005">005</a> | <a href="/Na'vi/days/#006">006</a> | <a href="/Na'vi/days/#007">007</a> | <a href="/Na'vi/days/#008">008</a> | <a href="/Na'vi/days/#009">009</a> | <a href="/Na'vi/days/#010">010</a></a></p>

            <h4 style="margin-bottom:0px" id="001">Day 1 - The sound of Na’vi</h4>
            <p><i>Trr a'awve - Pam lì'fyayä leNa'vi</i><br>Word of the day: <b>kaltxì - hello</b></p>
            <p>Maybe you just started today and are now really excited to learn this beautiful language - but where to start? This is one of the most asked questions in the Na’vi community. And the answer is nearly always the same: Learn the pronunciation! But how?</p>
            <p>Even though there are a lot of resources, the recommended way to learn about pronunciation is to meet with someone more experienced in voice chat and practice together. Of course not everyone has the possibility to enter voice chat due to technical issues, and some just don’t want to do so, for those I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5JKGL-o16">Pamìrìk's Pronunciation Lesson</a> on YouTube.</p>
            <p><b>Today's Task:</b> Learn about pronunciation - Ask in the Kelutral server for someone to practice with you, watch the video or choose another resource to learn from. Important is that you also practice it yourself, just reading about it/listening to others doing it does not count to fulfill today’s task! <br>For those of you who don’t know how to type the letters ä and ì this is also the perfect time to set that up - Most people use the English International keyboard on windows, but don’t hesitate to ask in the discord server if you have problems with that!</p>
            <br>
            <h4 style="margin-bottom:0px" id="002">Day 2 - Finding the right ressources</h4>
            <p><i>Trr amuve - Ftxey aysä’ot a tìnusumefpi</i><br>Word of the day: <b>irayo - thanks</b></p>
            <p>The Na’vi community provides a large amount of learning resources which is great, but it can be a bit overwhelming at the beginning, so it is a good idea to take a closer look at what you have to choose from. You can find an overview of many helpful resources on the <a href="https://www.kelutral.org/documents.html">Kelutral Website</a> and some additional in the resources section of the Kelutral Discord server:</p>
            <img style="width: 30%" src="../../images/resources.png">
            <br><br>
            <p><b>Today's Task:</b> Look through the resources. Choose at least one dictionary to use in your learning journey (the two most commonly used once are <a href="https://dict-navi.com/en/">Dict-Na'vi</a> and <a href="https://reykunyu.wimiso.nl/">Reykunyu</a>, which also is a bot in Kelutral and has the Annotated Dictionary by Plumps included), and take a brief look at a few grammar resources such as Na’vi as a second language to find out which one you like - the Lessons and Workbooks section on the Website will help you with that! Of course, one of the best resources for grammar explanations is the questions channel in Kelutral - There are always people to help you! A collection of useful phrases also is a nice thing to have, try to find at least one!</p>
            <p>From now on, if I say “Find out …”, you’ll have to go back to the resources you found today to do your own research! Tip: Having multiple things on hand can be very helpful because reading multiple different explanations of the same thing may help a lot to get a deeper understanding of it. And I cannot say that often enough: If anything is unclear, never hesitate to ask in the discord server!</p>
            <br>
            <h4 style="margin-bottom:0px" id="003">Day 3 - Finally some sentences</h4>
            <p><i>Trr apeyve - Lì'ukìng a'a'aw nì'i'a</i><br>Word of the day: <b>sran(e) - yes</b></p>
            <p>Now you know pronunciation, and you know where you can find information, so let’s get a first bit of information! Today you even have two small tasks.</p>
            <p><b>Today's Tasks:</b><br><b>1.</b> Remember that I told you to find some kind of phrasebook with useful sentences? Find and learn one sentence/expression each for:<br>&emsp;&emsp;a) Greeting someone (<i>Kaltxì</i> doesn’t count, you already learned that on day one!)<br>&emsp;&emsp;b) Saying goodbye<br>&emsp;&emsp;c) Introduce yourself<br>&emsp;&emsp;d) Asking "How are you?" and answering that question<br>Don’t worry about the grammar yet! You will learn about that later.<br><b>2.</b> “I walk”, “The dog eats”, “We play” - The easiest sentences just have a (pro)noun and a verb. Find out how to write these sentences in Na’vi, and write five of them!</p>
            <br>
            <h4 style="margin-bottom:0px"  id="004">Day 4 - First bit of grammar</h4>
            <p><i>Trr atsìve - 'awvea koren</i><br>Word of the day: <b>kehe - no</b></p>
            <p>Saying that the dog eats is great - but how to say that the dog eats for example meat? You will learn about this today!</p>
            <p><b>Today's Task:</b> Find out how to use a direct object - so how to say what is affected by an action. Some key words which you should understand after your research:<br>&emsp;&emsp;- transitive verb<br>&emsp;&emsp;- intransitive verb<br>&emsp;&emsp;- case ending<br>&emsp;&emsp;- -l/-t <br>&emsp;&emsp;- free word order<br>&emsp;&emsp;- subject<br>&emsp;&emsp;- direct object<br>Also make sure to find out when you don’t need the case endings! They are only used with certain verbs, and you don’t need them always.</p>
            <p>Write three sentences describing what you did during the past few days using what you learned today - Some examples of things you could write: I read a book, I cook food, I eat fruit, …</p>
            <br>
            <h4 style="margin-bottom:0px" id="005">Day 5 - Let’s do more small-talk!</h4>
            <p><i>Trr amrrve - Pängkxo ko!</i><br>Word of the day: <b>rutxe - please</b></p>
            <p>Let’s learn some more small-talk! You already learned the first phrases on day three, today it’s time to repeat them and build up on that. Learn some new vocab and sentences all around small-talk!</p>
            <p><b>Today's Task:</b> Go back to that useful phrase resource you used before. Pick at least 10 words/phrases and learn them. It’s up to you which ones you find the most useful and want to learn, but my recommendation is to pick phrases for various different situations instead of only greetings/different variants of ”how are you?” - for example it might be useful to be able to say stuff like “please repeat” or “what is X in Na’vi?”.</p>
            <p>After you learned some phrases, go into the Kelutral Discord server and start a conversation either in the nìNa’vi nì’aw or in the nìNa’vi nì’aw aysngä’iyufpi channel! Of course, with small-talk phrases only you will come to a point where you cannot answer to what was written with what you learned already - don’t worry, just try it anyway! Your Na’vi doesn’t have to be perfect to write in these channels, and there are always helpful people around. With a good dictionary to look up words no one can stop you!</p>
            <br>
            <h4 style="margin-bottom:0px" id="006">Day 6 - Practice, practice, practice…</h4>
            <p><i>Trr apuve - Tskxekeng si, tskxekeng si, tsskxekeng si...</i><br>Word of the day: <b>yom - to eat</b></p>
            <p>Before we learn some more grammar tomorrow, let’s have a day of repetition. Sounds boring, but language learning requires a lot of that - the more you repeat something, the better you will learn it. You always will have to repeat stuff a lot, no matter if it is vocab, common expressions or grammar. The best way to do so is by just using it! Randomly reading some words will not help much. You have to write sentences with them, use them in context. Same goes for grammar. Don’t just read about it - use it. You are not sure if you understood it completely? Show your practice sentences to other people so they can find and correct mistakes. This will help you clearing up stuff far better than just reading dry explanations again and again!</p>
            <p><b>Today's Task:</b> Practice -l/-t! How? It’s up to you. Write your own sentences, use my <a href="/Na'vi/exercises">Exercise collection</a>, ask people in Kelutral for some practice sentences…</p>
            <p>Make sure to read out loud everything you write in Na’vi - as today is practice day, also pronunciation should be practiced again!</p>
            <br>
            <h4 style="margin-bottom:0px" id="007">Day 7 - 3x to be</h4>
            <p><i>Trr akive - Pxehemlì'u alu lu, tok sì 'efu</i><br>Word of the day: <b>nitram - happy</b></p>
            <p>While learning you will discover very quickly that Na’vi isn’t just English with fancy words. Not only does it have its own grammar, but also many words have a different meaning than you would expect at first glance. Today we will see the first big difference in word usage between English and Na’vi!</p>
            <p><b>Today's Task:</b> Find out what exactly the difference is between the three verbs lu, ‘efu and tok. Which is used in which circumstance? Are they transitive or intransitive? Write two small example sentences with each verb.</p>
            <p>Hint: for the verb lu, there are actually three main usages! If you cannot find all, make sure to ask in the discord server. One of these usages includes the dative case which you will start learning tomorrow.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 style="margin-bottom:0px" id="008">Day 8 - Another case ending</h4>
            <p><i>Trr avolve - Lahea uolì’uvi</i><br>Word of the day: <b>sunu - to be likable</b></p>
            <p>Like you already saw before, Na’vi works with case endings on their nouns to describe their role in a sentence. Today you will start learning another one - the so-called indirect object, or dative. This one has a wide range of usages, and some of them are a bit strange for English speakers - but you will get used to it, if you just practice enough!</p>
            <p><b>Today's Task:</b> Find out what exactly the indirect object/dative is and how it is used in Na’vi. Some guiding questions you can follow to make sure you don’t miss something important:<br>&emsp;&emsp;- When do you need to use -r(u), when -ur?<br>&emsp;&emsp;- What are some examples of intransitive verbs that use the indirect object?<br>&emsp;&emsp;- What are si-verbs?<br>&emsp;&emsp;- What are some examples of transitive verbs which can use the dative?<br>&emsp;&emsp;- How do you say "I have a book" in Na’vi? You may have found out about that already yesterday.<br>Make sure to not only read dry explanations, but also look at a lot of example sentences to understand in which situations this case ending is used! You can ask people in the Discord server, or you can look for sentences in the <a href="http://ivongnavi.info/AnnotatedDictionary.pdf">Annotated Dictionary</a> by searching for a verb in there which you think would use this case ending. Tip: Reykunyu has the Annotated Dictionary included:</p>

            <h4 style="margin-bottom:0px" id="009">Day 9 - Let’s learn the pronouns!</h4>
            <p><i>Trr avolawve - Aylì’ut a na pum alu oe sì nga ftia ko!</i><br>Word of the day: <b>tute - person</b></p>
            <p>Pronouns are a key element of the language. They are words like “I”, “you” and similar ones - they are among the most often used words! So it is definitely worth taking a closer look at them and making sure to know them well early on.</p>
            <p><b>Today's Task:</b> Look at the basic pronouns: I, you, he/she/it, we, you, they. You will see that there are multiple different words for the plural forms - what is the difference? And what does “inclusive we” and “exclusive we” mean? Also try to find out what exactly the word "fko" means and how it is used!<br>You don’t need to know all the pronouns by heart yet. But make sure that you understand when which has to be used, also I recommend drawing yourself a table with all of them! Writing something down yourself helps a lot with remembering it.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 style="margin-bottom:0px" id="010">Day 10 - Test questions</h4>
            <p><i>Trr avomuve - Tìfmetok</i><br>Word of the day: <b>leyn - to repeat</b></p>
            <p>It is time to see what you’ve learned so far! Today’s task will be a small test to see what you need to repeat more often. This test is only for yourself, and it is not meant to grade/rate you - we are not in school, this is all for fun! It is just meant as an indicator for yourself to help you see if you have problems with some parts. There is no shame in needing more repetition, after all we are learning a whole new language here, and it can need a while to wrap your head around all the new structures and words!</p>
            <p><b>Today's Task:</b> Do the following exercises/answer the following questions. After you are finished, based on your results, choose one day of this chapter and do it again! You did everything correctly? Seysonìltsan, well done! Do some pronunciation practice instead, for example by saying the sentences people wrote in the nìNa’vi nì’aw channel.</p>
            <p><b>Phrases - </b>Are you able to...<br>&emsp;&emsp;... Greet someone?<br>&emsp;&emsp;... Tell them your name?<br>&emsp;&emsp;... Ask them how they are?<br>&emsp;&emsp;... Answer if they ask you how you are?<br>&emsp;&emsp;... Say goodbye?<br>Write down at least one answer for each point and check yourself afterwards if you wrote them down correctly (for example with your notes or with the phrasebook you are using).</p>
            <p><b>Pronouns - </b>Answer the following questions:<br>&emsp;&emsp;- What are the words “I”, “you” and “he/she” in Na’vi?<br>&emsp;&emsp;- What is the difference between the inclusive and exclusive we?<br>&emsp;&emsp;- What is the difference between “mefo”, “pxefo” and “(ay)fo”?<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Can you write an example sentence using “fko”?<br>&emsp;&emsp;- We have “poan”/”poe” and “po” - which are used when?<br>Check the answers with your notes! If anything is unclear, ask in the Kelutral server for help.</p>
            <p><b>Grammar - </b>Find the mistakes in the following sentences:<br>&emsp;&emsp;a) Pol hahaw. <span class="spoiler">Po hahaw.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;b) Ngati inan pukìl. <span class="spoiler">Ngal inan pukit.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;c) Oel sunu syulangit. <span class="spoiler">Oeru sunu syulang.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;d) Oe lu fìtseng. <span class="spoiler">Oel tok fìtsengti.</span></p>
